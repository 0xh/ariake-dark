## Ariake Dark color theme for Visual Studio Code

This is (a bit customized) port of [Ariake Dark Syntax theme](https://github.com/pathtrk/ariake-dark-syntax) made by [@pathtrk](https://github.com/pathtrk/)

Ariake is an atom syntax theme inspired by Japanese traditional colors and the poetry composed 1000 years ago.

"有明の　つれなく見えし　別れより　暁ばかり　憂きものはなし" - Mibu no Tadamine (壬生忠岑)

"Since I saw the moon in dawn when you said good-bye, My heart aches every time I see it again."
